# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Model
This is a Python program designed to predict whether passengers aboard the Titanic survived the sinking or not. It employs various machine learning algorithms to analyze passenger data and make predictions based on features such as passenger class, sex, number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), and number of parents/children aboard (Parch).
